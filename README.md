# Programming fonts

When I install a new IDE in my computer, the first thing I do is change font.

A good font in IDE will let your coding productivity significantly improved.

Let me recommand a few programming fonts for you I used.

1. [Fira code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

  Fira code is what I most like to use in my IDE, because it has fontLigatures type. Programmer always use lot of symbols in any language, so Fira code's fontLigatures will change symbols to let your brain to know what is this symbol is doing easily.
  
  But Fira code's fontLigatures feature is not support in any IDE, you can check it in [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode#editor-support).
  
2. [Source code pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)

  Source code pro is designed by Adobe, and it is an awesome monospaced font. It works perfectly in any enviroment or IDE.
  
3. [Programma](https://github.com/douglascrockford/Programma)

  Programma is designed by [Douglas Crockford](https://github.com/douglascrockford). Douglas Crockford design JSON data type what we use always in our Web design. JSON is a masterpiece in our world, Awesome!
  
4. Consola
  
  Consola is a commercial font, so it means Consola is not free. Consola is designed for Microsoft’s ClearType font family, so if your computer has install Microsoft software or your computer is Windows OS then you can use Consola in your IDE.
  

Importantly, 

All these fonts for free!
